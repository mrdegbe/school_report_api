**School Terminal Report Generator**

---

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**

To build a **digital system** for schools that:

* **Collects**, **stores**, and **manages** student academic data (scores, subjects, terms, years).
* Automatically **calculates results**: total marks, averages, positions/ranks within class.
* **Generates well-formatted terminal reports** (printable or downloadable as PDF/Excel).
* Enables teachers & admins to **input and update marks easily** via a secure online interface.
* Provides insights for teachers, parents, and students on academic progress.
* Scales to support multiple classes, subjects, terms, and years — for one or many schools.

## ⚙️ **How it works (functional flow)**

1️⃣ **Data Input**

* Admins/teachers add students, subjects, classes, and term/year info.
* Teachers enter raw scores for each student per subject.

2️⃣ **Processing**

* The system aggregates marks, calculates averages, grades, ranks, and remarks based on pre-defined grading rules.
* It can handle multiple terms and academic years.

3️⃣ **Output**

* Generate **individual terminal reports** per student — includes personal info, subject scores, averages, position in class, teacher comments.
* Reports can be **viewed online**, **downloaded**, or **printed**.

4️⃣ **User Management**

* Different roles: admin (full control), teachers (limited to input & view), possibly students/parents (view-only).

5️⃣ **Scalability**

* Support hundreds or thousands of students.
* Possible multi-school support later (turn it into SaaS).
